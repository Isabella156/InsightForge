### description
This Solidity file defines an ERC20 standard token contract. The ERC20 standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.

### purpose
The purpose of this contract is to create a fungible token system on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens can be transferred between accounts and used in decentralized applications as a means of transaction or interaction.
